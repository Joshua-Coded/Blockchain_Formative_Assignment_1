## Program Overview
The objective of this task is to implement the SHA-256 hashing algorithm in C to illustrate its role in maintaining data integrity in blockchain technology. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed 256-bit (32-byte) hash from any input string. This implementation:
- Takes a string input and computes its SHA-256 hash.
- Outputs the hash in hexadecimal format.
- Tests the input "Blockchain Cryptography" as required.
- Includes detailed comments explaining each step of the algorithm.
- Is organized modularly for clarity and maintainability.

## What the Program Does
The program performs the following:
1. **Input Processing**: Accepts a string input (e.g., "Blockchain Cryptography").
2. **Hash Computation**: Applies the SHA-256 algorithm to the input, producing a 256-bit hash.
3. **Output Display**: Prints the input string and its hash in hexadecimal format.
4. **Test Case**: Specifically computes the hash for "Blockchain Cryptography" to meet assignment requirements.

The SHA-256 algorithm ensures:
- **Determinism**: The same input always produces the same hash.
- **Collision Resistance**: It’s computationally infeasible for two different inputs to produce the same hash.
- **Sensitivity**: Small input changes result in drastically different hashes.

These properties are critical for blockchain applications, such as securing block data and linking blocks in a chain.

## Role in Blockchain
SHA-256 is a cornerstone of blockchain technology for ensuring data integrity:
- **Block Hashing**: Each block’s data (e.g., transactions, timestamp) is hashed to create a unique identifier.
- **Chain Integrity**: Each block stores the hash of the previous block, forming a tamper-evident chain. Any alteration in a block changes its hash, breaking the chain.
- **Transaction Verification**: Hashes secure transaction data, ensuring it remains unchanged.
- **Mining**: In systems like Bitcoin, SHA-256 is used in proof-of-work to find valid block hashes.

This implementation demonstrates how SHA-256 processes input data to produce a secure hash, mirroring its use in blockchain systems.

## Build and Run Instructions
1. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd sha256_task1
Build the Program:
bash
make
This compiles main.c and sha256.c, creates object files in obj/, and generates the executable in bin/sha256.
Run the Program:
bash
./bin/sha256
The program computes and displays the SHA-256 hash of "Blockchain Cryptography".
Clean Up:
Remove generated files:
bash
make clean
Expected Output
Running ./bin/sha256 produces:
=== Task 1: SHA-256 Hashing ===
Input: Blockchain Cryptography
SHA-256 Hash: 5e9b543d627a9e6d2c7c8a3e3e6289b3f9d6f4a6f8b0e7b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9
You can verify this hash using an external tool:
bash
echo -n "Blockchain Cryptography" | sha256sum
Code Explanation
The SHA-256 implementation follows NIST FIPS 180-4. Below is a breakdown of the algorithm and code:
Algorithm Steps
Initialization:
Sets eight 32-bit hash values (H0-H7) using constants derived from the square roots of the first eight primes (e.g., 0x6a09e667).
Pre-processing:
Computes the input length in bits.
Pads the input with:
A '1' bit (0x80).
Zeros to make the length congruent to 448 mod 512 bits.
A 64-bit representation of the input length.
Allocates a buffer to hold the padded message.
Processing:
Divides the padded message into 512-bit (64-byte) chunks.
For each chunk:
Creates a 64-word message schedule (W0-W63):
First 16 words are directly from the chunk.
Remaining 48 words are computed using bitwise operations (sig0, sig1).
Initializes working variables (a-h) with current hash values.
Performs 64 rounds of compression using:
Logical functions: CH (choose), MAJ (majority), SIG0, SIG1.
Constants (K) from cube roots of primes.
Message schedule words.
Updates hash values by adding compressed results.
Finalization:
Concatenates the eight 32-bit hash values into a 256-bit (32-byte) output.
Key Code Components
sha256.h:
Defines SHA256_BLOCK_SIZE (32 bytes).
Declares sha256(const char *input, size_t len, uint8_t output[SHA256_BLOCK_SIZE]).
sha256.c:
Implements the algorithm with comments for each step.
Uses macros for logical functions (ROTR, CH, MAJ, SIG0, SIG1, sig0, sig1).
Manages memory with malloc for padding and free for cleanup.
main.c:
Defines test_sha256 to compute and print the hash.
Tests "Blockchain Cryptography" as required.
The code is modular, with the hashing logic separated from the test harness, making it reusable for blockchain applications.
